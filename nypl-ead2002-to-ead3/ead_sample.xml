    <bioghist>
      <p>Edward Alfred Allworth, professor emeritus of Turco-Soviet Studies in the Middle Eastern and Asian Languages and Cultures Department at Columbia University, is a specialist on ethnic minority populations in former Soviet Central Asia. He was born December 1, 1920, the son of Edward and Ethel (Walker) Allworth. He received his bachelor's degree from Oregon State University, followed by a master's from the University of Chicago, and a Ph.D. from Columbia University. After working at both Reed College and the Ford Foundation, Professor Allworth returned to Columbia, where he would spend the majority of his professional career focusing on Central Asia.</p>
      <p>Allworth was director of the Program on Soviet Nationality Problems beginning in 1970, head of the Center for the Study of Central Asia, and general editor of the Central Asia Book Series beginning in 1983. Among his numerous works as an author and editor were: <title>Central Asian Publishing and the Rise of Nationalism</title>; <title>The Modern Uzbeks: from the fourteenth century to the present</title>; <title>Uzbek Literary Politics</title>; <title>The Nationality Question in Soviet Central Asia</title>; and <title>Nationality Group Survival in Multiethnic States</title>.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <p>Edward Allworth's papers, spanning 1944 to 1994, document his interest in and research on ethnic minority groups and the question of nationality in Soviet Central Asia and on the Soviet conflict in Afghanistan. Populations represented in the collection are Crimean Tatars, Uzbeks, Tajiks and Bukharan Jews.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged by ethnic group. Materials consist of correspondence, manuscripts, research files and statistical analysis, photographs, oral history and interview recordings, biographical scrapbooks, printed matter, and artifacts.</p>
      <p>The Afghan files contain newspaper clippings and other printed matter on the Soviet conflict, and Arabic manuscripts of unknown date, obtained by Professor Allworth from a dealer operating in the country.</p>
      <p>Items related to Crimean Tatars focus on their experiences of deportation to Central Asia in 1944, activist movements beginning in the 1960s, and their push for the right of return to the Crimea in the 1980s. A significant amount of material was received from activist and author Reshat Djemilev, including an extensive oral history, in Russian.</p>
      <p>The Uzbek materials consist of the "Uzbek Intelligentsia Project," which looked at the integration of ethnic Uzbeks into the Uzbek Soviet and larger USSR Supreme Soviet. These materials consist of selected research files compiled on members of both Soviets, and statistical printouts analyzing Allworth's collected data. There are also files related to Allworth's translation work of Abdalfauf Fitrat.</p>
      <p>The Tajik section of documents, the smallest in the collection, consists of writings by Mordekhay Bachaev; interviews in Hebrew of members of the small ethnic and religious minority of Bukharan Jews; newspaper clippings on the resurgence of a Muslim identity in Dushanbe following the fall of the Soviet Union; and other printed matter.</p>
      <p>In Arabic, Crimean Tatar, English, French, German, Hebrew, Polish, Pushto, Russian, Tajik and Uzbek. Although much of the collection consists of materials using the Latin alphabet, many texts are present with the Arabic and Cyrillic alphabet. There is also one example of a Tajik language document represented in both Cyrillic and Hebrew (<title>Ghazaliet</title> in box 7).</p>

          <p>The Afghanistan files do not focus on a particular ethnic group. Rather, they are a small collection of disparate materials about, and from, that country. The files consist of manuscripts in Arabic and Cyrillic script, correspondence related to their provenance, transcripts of an interview with author Faizullah Aimaq on Kabul radio, and collected printed matter on Afghanistan.</p>
          <p>The older manuscripts are of unknown date, and several appear to have been purchased through a manuscripts dealer working with sources in Afghanistan. Related correspondence indicates two of the documents are in Arabic, and one in an unidentified language thought to be similar to the Chaghatay language spoken by Chinese Turkestanis.</p>
          <p>The transcript (in Uzbek, written in Cyrillic) of a 1976 radio interview with Faizullah Aimaq is located in box 1, folder 2. It is also available as digital sound files; see Series VI).</p>
          <p>Also included amongst the Afghan materials are several folders of printed matter, consisting of various article clippings on Afghanistan, a 1981 copy of the Pushto language newspaper Zeray, and newspaper clippings on the Soviet-Afghan conflict.</p>
          <p>In Arabic, English, Pushto and Uzbek.</p>

          <p>The Crimean Tatar files focus on members of this ethnic group's 1944 deportation under Stalin's order to Central Asia, and their efforts, beginning in the 1960s, to obtain the right of return. Allworth's support for Crimean Tatar activism is documented in this collection of materials, as are his efforts to record deportees' personal experiences. Among the items present are correspondence and photographs; manuscripts, autobiographies and diaries; a recorded oral history; Allworth's own research and writings; and papers from the Ismail Gaspirali Fund at Columbia University.</p>
          <p>Correspondence consists of letters regarding research, Allworth's attempts to assist in publishing a samizdat manuscript, general exchanges with contacts in the Soviet Union, information on Reshat Djemilev and Mustapha Cemilev, publications from the Organization of Crimean Tatars Nationalist Movement, and photographs of Crimean Tatar protests in the Soviet Union in 1988.</p>
          <p>Among the manuscripts included is a photocopy of the samizdat text of the Tashkent Trial, a 1969 trial of Crimean Tatar dissidents which galvanized the Tatar population in the USSR and abroad. Also included are a biographical scrapbook on Eskender Ganeevich Umerov, manuscripts of Reshat Djemilev's Reflections and Short Analysis of Events During the Moscow Summer, and miscellaneous documents and photographs obtained from Djemilev. See Series VI for a lengthy oral history given by Djemilev in Russian.</p>
          <p>Following the manuscripts are a number of notebooks of unknown provenance on various Crimean Tatar topics. These appear to be different from Allworth's own research and writing files, which focus on the growing national identity movement, Soviet policy towards the ethnic group, and the question of a Crimean Tatar "historical memory." These notebooks include materials in a number of languages, including Crimean Tatar.</p>
          <p>The Crimean Tatar materials also contain papers related to the Ismail Gaspirali Fund. The fund, founded by Tatars in New York City, was established to make a small donation to Columbia University's Center for the Study of Central Asia for the purpose of obtaining and translating materials on current affairs in the region.</p>
          <p>In Crimean Tatar, English, French, German, Polish and Russian.</p>

          <p>Allworth's materials related to Uzbeks and Uzbekistan stem from his project analyzing ethnic minority participation in the Supreme Soviet. The project was alternately referred to in his notes as the "Uzbek Intelligentsia Project."</p>
          <p>The project analyzed Uzbek influence in the USSR through an examination of Uzbek members of the Supreme Soviet, compared with those in the Uzbek Soviet. Materials consist of selected "data sheets" on each member, statistical reports labeled "cross-tabulations" and "frequencies," project management materials, and other miscellany.</p>
          <p>The "cross-tabulations" look at factors such as education, rural vs. urban origin, gender, locality (oblast, krai, etc.), and former employment. Also included are comparisons of Uzbek members with Azerbaijanis and Tajiks, and comparisons across gender, by birth year, committee, and doctorate vs. candidate degrees.</p>
          <p>Also present in this series are essays, drafts, research notes, and professional correspondence related to Allworth’s translation work and research on Uzbek literature and history, which focuses heavily on the writer and theorist Abdalrauf Fitrat. The Fitrat texts included in the collection are <title>Bidil</title>, <title>Qiyamät</title>, <title>Satan’s Mutiny Against the Lord</title>, and <title>The Judgment Day</title>. Some of the translation work was funded by an NEH grant, and includes Allworth’s progress reports on the project.</p>
          <p>There is also an index to the Turki journal, <title>Ayina</title>, which was published from 1913 to 1915 and edited by Mahmud Khoja Behbudiy. This chronological index was compiled by Allworth and his graduate assistants, and contains extensive annotations.</p>
          <p>In English, Uzbek, French, Tajik, and Turkish. The Uzbek materials are mostly printed in Cyrillic script, with some texts also in Arabic script.</p>
