# EAD2002 to EAD3 Walkthrough

This directory contains an Encoded Archival Description record (`ead_sample.xml`) that will be transformed from EAD2002 into valid EAD3.  A step-by-step walkthrough of the EAD2002-to-EAD3 migration process can be viewed by following the commit log for `ead_sample.xml`.

The migration process will begin with a valid EAD2002 record generated by NYPL's Archives Portal (http://archives.nypl.org/mss/3621) and migrate to full EAD3.

## Why Git Commits?

`git commit` is a powerful tool for viewing and managing different versions of files.  Git allows for line-by-line comparisons of each version of a file; for example, we can see exactly what changed when implementing EAD3's `<controlaccess>` by comparing that commit against the one before it.

## How Do I View The Commit Log?

Github has a clear interface for viewing changes between versions, accessible by clicking "History" at the top of this page.  This will call up the log of changes made to `README.md` and `ead_sample.xml`; from there, clicking on a commit name will bring up the description and line-by-line list of changes.
